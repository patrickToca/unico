<h1>404 Not Found</h1>

<p>That's a bit embarrassing, isn't it? I wonder what you were looking for
here... whatever it was, it's not here. So sorry.</p>

<p>All is not lost though! You might just have been lucky enough to 
accidentally arrive at the right place. Well, almost the right place...
you know what I mean. Have you ever been annoyed of having to 
maintain several social networks? OMG ME TOO!!</p>

<p><a href="/">Unico</a> copies your public statuses from 
<a href="http://plus.google.com">Google+</a> into other social networks.
Just <a href="/">Click here</a> to solve all of your problems forever!.</p>
